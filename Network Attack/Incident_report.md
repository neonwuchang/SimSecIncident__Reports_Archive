## Section 1: Identify the type of attack that may have caused this network interruption
The client's website's connection timeout error may have been caused by a DoS SYN flood attack
from the suspected IP address 203.0.113.0, as indicated by the network logs. 

## Section 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction
The large number of SYN packets being sent by the malicious actor are overwhelming the server
by consuming available resources, thereby increasing the response time for legitimate requests to 
the extent that it exceeeds the Time to Live of the legitimate SYN packets. As indicated by the logs,
the server has been overwhelmed by the SYN flood and is unable to process legitimate SYN requests,
rendering the website inaccessible to users, who receive a connection timeout error message when they
try to connect to the website. The normal business operation of the website is interrupted.
