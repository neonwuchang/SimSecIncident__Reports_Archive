# About
This project contains incident reports based on three separate security incident simulations. The analyst's role presented in each scenario is different. Thus, the type and depth of investigation and/or management in each scenario differs as does the intended audience for the report. Each report reflects its specific simulated background scenario. 

Important disclaimer: The scenarios and data used are sourced from the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.
